AppImage for KDE bomber

Bomber is a single player arcade game. The player is invading various cities in a plane that is decreasing in height.

The goal of the game is to destroy all the buildings and advance to the next level. Each level gets a bit harder by increasing the speed of the plane and the height of the buildings.
